## This is my final project biography. 

First, I will give an overview of what I am aiming to accomplish. Then, I will go item by item on the final project checklist to ensure all requirements have been met. 

## General Overview:

The original goal of this project was to automate the "Drop LLC" process during real estate transactions in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. As we spoke in class this was an ambitious scope and after getting my hands dirty I decided to narrow to automating the purchase and sale agreement only.
